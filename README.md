## Iris Flowers Classification Project

This machine learning project focuses on classifying Iris flowers using the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is often considered the "Hello World" of machine learning, making it an ideal starting point for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms and data visualization.

The project involves loading the dataset, performing data exploration, visualizing the data using various plots, and implementing logistic regression for classification. The goal is to train a model that can predict the class of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.6)
- Required Python libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flowers-classification.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd iris-flowers-classification
```
3.Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Run the main analysis script:
```bash
python main_analysis.py
```
This script will load the Iris dataset, perform data exploration, visualize the data using pair plots, correlation heatmaps, box plots, and count plots. It will also implement logistic regression for classification, predict class labels, and display the decision boundary visualization.

## Additional Visualizations
The project provides examples of various visualizations to help you better understand the dataset. Feel free to explore and modify the code to create more custom visualizations that suit your analysis goals.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or suggestions, feel free to create a pull request.
